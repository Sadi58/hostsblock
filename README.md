# Hostsblock

An **ad-blocking** and **malware-blocking** script for *Linux*

## Description

**`Hostsblock`** is a `bash` script designed to take advantage of
[`/etc/hosts`][h] file to provide [**system-wide blocking**][0] of
**internet advertisements, malicious domains, trackers, and
other undesirable content**.

To do so, it downloads a **configurable** set of blocklists and processes their
entries into a single [`/etc/hosts`][h] file.

`Hostsblock` also includes `hostsblock-urlcheck`, a command-line utility that
allows you to block and unblock certain websites and any other domains
contained in that website.

## Features

*   **System-wide blocking** - *All non-proxied* connections use the HOSTS
  file (Proxied connections can adopt the HOSTS file)

*   **Compressed-friendly** - Can download and process compressed files
  **automatically**.  (Currently only `zip` and `7zip` are supported)

*   **Non-interactive** - Can be run as a periodic `cronjob` or `systemd timer`
  without needing user interaction.

*   **Extensive configurability** - Allows for custom **black & white listing**,
  **redirection**, **post-processing scripting**, *etc.*

*   **Bandwith-efficient** - *Only* downloads blocklists that have been changed,
  uses *compression* when available.

*   **Resource-efficient** - *Only* processes blocklists when changes are
  registered, uses *minimal pipes*.

*   **High performance blocking** - **Only** when using *dns caching* and
  *pseudo-server* daemons.

*   **Redirection capability** - **Enchance security** and combats [DNS cache
  poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_cache_poisoning).

*   **Extensive choice of blocklists included** - It is up to the *user* to
  **choose** how much or how little is blocked/redirected.

## Dependencies

*   [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)
*   [GNU bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html)
*   [GNU sed](http://www.gnu.org/software/sed)
*   [GNU grep](http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/grep.html)
*   [GNU coreutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils).

### Optional dependencies for **additional features**

**Unarchivers** to use archive blocklists instead of plain text:

*   [unzip][unzip] (for zip archives)
*   [p7zip][7zip] (for 7z archives) must include either 7z or 7za executables!

**A DNS caching daemon** to help *speed up DNS resolutions*:

*   [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) (recommended)
*   [pdnsd](http://members.home.nl/p.a.rombouts/pdnsd/) (untested)

**A pseudo-server** that serves *blank pages* to remove boilerplate page and
speed up page resolution on blocked domains:

*   [kwakd](https://github.com/fetchinson/kwakd/) (recommended)
*   [pixelserv](http://proxytunnel.sourceforge.net/pixelserv.php)

**Compressors** to compress backup files and the annotation database:

*   [gzip](http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/)
*   [pigz](http://www.zlib.net/pigz/)

## Installation

### Arch Linux

`cd pkg; makepkg -Acsir`

Or use one of the *AUR* packages:
[hostsblock](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hostsblock/),
[hostsblock-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hostsblock-git/)

### For others

```sh
install -Dm755 hostsblock.sh /usr/sbin/hostsblock
install -Dm755 hostsblock-urlcheck.sh /usr/sbin/hostsblock-urlcheck
install -Dm644 hostsblock.conf /etc/hostsblock/hostsblock.conf
install -Dm644 black.list /etc/hostsblock/black.list
install -Dm644 white.list /etc/hostsblock/white.list
install -Dm644 hosts.head /etc/hostsblock/hosts.head
```

**Don't forget** to *enable* and *start* the systemd timer with:
`systemctl enable --now hostsblock.timer `

Refer to the *man pages* for more info about hostsblock's **usage**.
(Currently useless! see  [#19](https://github.com/gaenserich/hostsblock/issues/19))

## Configuration

All the Hostsblock configuration is done in the [`hostsblock.conf`][conf].
This file is commented really good, please read through it before first use.

### Dnsmasq

To use Hostsblock together with Dnsmasq, configure Dnsmasq as DNS cashing daemon.
Pleas refer to your distribution's manual. For Archlinux read the following:
[Wiki section](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/dnsmasq#DNS_cache_setup).

#### hostsblock.conf

In the *FINAL HOSTSFILE* section, enable `hostsfile="/etc/hosts.block`.

In the *POSTPROCESSING SUBROUTINE* section enable:

```conf
postprocess(){
    systemctl restart dnsmasq.service # For dnsmasq under systemd
}
```

#### dnsmasq.conf

Set `addn-hosts=` to `addn-hosts=/etc/hosts.block`

## FAQ

*   Why isn't it working with Chrome/Chromium?

    *   Because they bypass the systems DNS settings and use their own.
    To force them to use the system's DNS settings, refer to this
    [superuser.com](https://superuser.com/questions/723703/why-is-chromium-bypassing-etc-hosts-and-dnsmasq) question.
