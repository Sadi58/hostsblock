Hostsblock
==========
An **ad-blocking** and **malware-blocking** script for *Linux*

Description
-----------
**`Hostsblock`** is a `bash` script designed to take advantage of
[`/etc/hosts`][h] file to provide [**system-wide blocking**][0] of **internet
advertisements, malicious domains, trackers, and other undesirable content**.

To do so, it downloads a **configurable** set of blocklists and processes their
entries into a single [`/etc/hosts`][h] file.

`Hostsblock` also includes `hostsblock-urlcheck`, a command-line utility that
allows you to block and unblock certain websites and any other domains
contained in that website.

Features
--------

* **System-wide blocking** - **_All_ non-proxied** connections use the HOSTS
  file (Proxied connections can adopt the HOSTS file)

* **Compressed-friendly** - Can download and process compressed files
  **automatically**.  (Currently only `zip` and `7zip` are supported)

* **Non-interactive** - Can be run as a periodic **cronjob** or systemd service
  without needing user interaction.

* **Extensive configurability** - Allows for custom **black & white listing**,
  **redirection**, **post-processing scripting**, *etc.*

* **Bandwith-efficient** - *Only* downloads blocklists that have been changed,
  uses *compression* when available.

* **Resource-efficient** - *Only* processes blocklists when changes are
  registered, uses *minimal pipes*.

* **High performance blocking** - **Only** when using *dns caching* and
  *pseudo-server* daemons.

* **Redirection capability** - **Enchance security** and combats [DNS cache
  poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_cache_poisoning).

* **Extensive choice of blocklists included** - It is up to the *user* to
  **choose** how much or how little is blocked/redirected.
